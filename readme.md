{Self-Ctrl} 
================================
A chrome extension which takes facebook content down with gravity.

How do I install this?
-------------------------
* Clone/download this extension
* Open Chrome
* Hit the menu button on top right > Tools > Extensions
* Click on the "Developer mode" checkbox on the top if its not already checked
* Click on "Load unpacked extension"
* Select the {Self-Ctrl} folder
* Start Facebook!

Statutory warning: It was a two day class projects and requires a lot of polishing and features.
I would love to have your feedback.
